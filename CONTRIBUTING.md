CONTRIBUTING
============

Any contribution is welcome.

All contributions must be tested following the current test structure:
- One class = one test file
- One class method = one method in the test class and must be annotated with ``@covers``
- Complexe tests must be placed in the ``scenario`` directory 

Look at current tests in ``test/suites`` for more informations
